This is a sample Todo application created with ASP.NET MVC 4 and jQuery.

The original sample in PHP and jQuery can be found on DotInstall's web site.

It was really fun to spend a couple of hours playing with jQuery and ASP.NET MVC 4.

I really appreciate the great works on DotInstall.com. 

THANK YOU!
